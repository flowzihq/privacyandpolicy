    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 28 October 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Flowzi Pty Ltd ("Flowzi", "we", "us", "our") operates <a href="https://www.flowzi.com.au">https://www.flowzi.com.au</a> and the Flowzi web application (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you use our website and web application.</p>

    <h2>2. Company details</h2>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> Flowzi Pty Ltd<br />
       <strong>Address:</strong> 42B Milky Way, Campbelltown NSW 2560, Australia<br />
       <strong>Privacy contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:suman@flowzi.com.au">suman@flowzi.com.au</a></p>

    <h2>3. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy covers personal information collected through our website and web application, including information collected via API, forms, cookies, and automatic logging.</p>

    <h2>4. Types of information we collect</h2>
    <p>Per your configuration, Flowzi collects the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> page visits, session logs, device and browser information, IP addresses (where required for logs/analytics), performance and error logs, and cookies used to improve the Service and measure usage.</li>
      <li><strong>AI chat and message data:</strong> messages, prompts, conversation history and related metadata that users send or generate within the Flowzi web app. This includes content that may be used by AI features to provide responses or process tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, operate, maintain and improve the Service (including AI features).</li>
      <li>To analyze usage patterns and product performance, diagnose technical issues, and optimize user experience via analytics and logs.</li>
      <li>To develop, train, and improve AI systems where applicable — e.g., processing chat inputs to generate responses and to maintain conversation history for a better user experience.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to store preferences, enable core functionality, and collect analytics. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect Service functionality.</p>

    <h2>7. Third parties and service providers</h2>
    <p>We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analytics and monitoring providers (for usage and performance data).</li>
      <li>Cloud hosting and database providers (to store logs or chat data).</li>
      <li>AI service providers or APIs used to power AI features or generate responses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We require third parties to protect the personal information they process on our behalf and not to use it for other purposes. If you want Flowzi to list the specific vendors we use (for example the analytics or AI provider names), contact us at <a href="mailto:suman@flowzi.com.au">suman@flowzi.com.au</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Because we may engage service providers or host data outside Australia, your information may be transferred to and processed in other countries. Where transfers occur, we take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>9. Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain usage logs, analytics, and AI chat data for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Retention periods may vary by data type and purpose. If you need specific retention periods, contact us at <a href="mailto:suman@flowzi.com.au">suman@flowzi.com.au</a>.</p>

    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no system is completely secure — if you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>11. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights or to request a copy of your data, contact <a href="mailto:suman@flowzi.com.au">suman@flowzi.com.au</a>. We may ask for information to confirm your identity before fulfilling requests.</p>

    <h2>12. Children</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 16 provided us with personal information, contact us and we will take prompt steps to delete that information.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes we will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Continued use of the Service after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
